# Carbon-Footprint-Monitoring
This project aims in developing a real-time energy monitoring system with carbon footprint calculation from electrical appliance and also smart control of electrical appliances.

# Introduction
Effective management and monitoring of energy usage is becoming more and more important as sustainability and energy efficiency gain importance.
In an era where energy efficiency and environmental sustainability are paramount, the Smart Appliance Control and Carbon Footprint Monitoring System represents a forward-thinking approach to managing energy consumption and reducing carbon emissions.

# Problem Statement 
In the modern world, excessive energy consumption is a big problem, and using electrical appliances inefficiently contributes greatly to this problem. 
Effective energy management is hampered by the frequent lack of real-time monitoring and remote control capabilities in current systems. Furthermore, consumers are unable to easily evaluate how their electricity use affects the environment, including the carbon footprint. 
The necessity of this project is driven by the absence of an integrated system that offers remote control, monitoring, and environmental effect assessment.

# Methodology / Block Diagram
* A carbon footprint is the total sum of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions caused by an organization, event, product, or person.
* The increasing concentration of GHGs in the atmosphere can accelerate climate change and global warming.
* It is very necessary to measure these emissions from our day-to-day activities.
